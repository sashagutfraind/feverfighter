# Introduction

This FeverFighter app provides a policy planning tool for controling respiratory infections in communities, schools or other institutions such as workplaces, colleges, prisons.  

1. Set the outbreak parameters
2. Run the simulation
3. Review the outcomes

The outbreak considers

1. the pathogen's rates of symptoms and shedding
2. patients' awareness of symptoms
3. patients' ability to self-quarantine
4. policy to quarantine those who recently had fever

The predictor uses a system of difference equations that calculates the transmission and return rates.

Example: Run the model, then change the policy to "1 day" and examine the attack rate.


Full details on the model are found in our Publication and the Help Tab
